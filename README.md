# Face-Detection-and-Tracking-Using-OpenCv-Python-and-Arduino-Serial-Communication

## Working Prenciple
>How the project works: Your face is recognized using OpenCv and Python. Your face is tried to be brought to the center according to the position of your face on the screen. The data produced in Python is sent to the Arduino, which processes them and sends them to the servo motors. <br/>
